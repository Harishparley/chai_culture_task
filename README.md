# ☕ Chai Culture - Premium Brand Landing Page

A high-fidelity, responsive landing page designed for **Chai Culture**, a US-based premium instant chai brand. This project focuses on delivering a "Royal" aesthetic using a deep brown and gold color palette, sophisticated typography, and modern CSS layout techniques.

## 🎨 Design & Features

### 1. The "Royal" Aesthetic
* **Color Palette:** Strictly adhered to the brand's requirement of Deep Brown (`#3E2723`) and Royal Gold (`#D4AF37`) to evoke warmth and luxury.
* **Typography:** Used *Playfair Display* for headings to reflect heritage and tradition, paired with *Lato* for modern readability.

### 2. Technical Highlights
* **Vertical Gradient Overlay:** Implemented a custom CSS `linear-gradient` on the hero section. It transitions from solid dark brown (top 50%) to transparent (bottom), ensuring text readability while smoothly revealing the high-quality tea background image at the footer.
* **Responsive Grid Layout:** The "Royal Flavors" section uses a flexible flexbox layout that displays 5 cards in a single row on desktop and stacks them elegantly on mobile devices.
* **Glassmorphism & Hover Effects:** Flavor cards feature a subtle lift animation (`transform: translateY`) and a dark glass-like background on hover to encourage user interaction.
* **Full-Width Card Imagery:** Product cards are designed with `object-fit: cover` to maximize visual impact without distorting the product images.
